        <p> Here you will find a website dedicated to the love (or hate) of a randomly selected set of photos, taken and owned by
            someone else, shown on a website built mainly by someone else and scrutinised by someone else. However, I wrote all this
            text so I'm the author and I can use this page to tell you all about me.</p>
        <p>My name is Ben. I make average websites that very few people see and hardly anybody uses. Not even the tickets website....
            We worked really hard on that.
